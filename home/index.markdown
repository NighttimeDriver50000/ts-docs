## TachibanaSite

TachibanaSite is a web framework used on this site ([tachibanatech.com](/)) and
the USC AFRL site ([afrl.cse.sc.edu](http://afrl.cse.sc.edu)).  It is made to
suit the needs of the AFRL and my (Chris McKinney's)
[whims](/chris/alaska2016/), but is very general and could be used for a
variety of websites.
